# scratch-nosystemd-patch
this is a patch for scratch downloaded using pacman to make sound work on distros that dont use systemd

if the script didnt work go to the cloned directory then write
cp so.vm-sound-ALSA /usr/lib/squeak/**version**
to know the version press tab once or double tab and the options will be shown
i dont know how to use shell scripts thats why it may break but i dont think that this will happen
